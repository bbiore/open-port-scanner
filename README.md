# open-port-scanner
 Description:
Developed a Python-based open port scanning utility for lab-based network security testing. The tool was created using an AI-assisted workflow to accelerate development, followed by manual optimization for reliability and accuracy. Designed to integrate into a simulated SIEM pipeline for real-time alerting in controlled test environments.

 Features:

Supports TCP/UDP scanning on custom port ranges.

AI-assisted code generation with human validation for security compliance.

Configurable timeout and concurrency for testing different network response conditions.

Safe mode for scanning only authorized lab networks.

Outputs scan results to JSON for integration with security tools.

 Skills Demonstrated:

Network fundamentals (TCP/UDP, sockets, port states).

Python scripting & automation.

AI-assisted development with human-in-the-loop refinement.

Secure testing methodologies in isolated environments.

 Security Disclaimer:
This project is intended for authorized security testing only in lab or client-approved environments. It is not to be used for scanning networks without explicit permission.
